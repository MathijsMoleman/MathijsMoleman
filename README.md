Project Frontiers 

Project Frontiers is a school project where we had to make a game with a group of students. We tried to make a fun escape room inside of a castle that you needed to escape from an evil wizard. In this project I was a programmer and made the user interface mechanics, made some puzzle mechanics, helped my other engineer with code if he didnâ€™t came out of how to do something and he helped me if I didnâ€™t come out of something. We worked really well together.

This is our itch.io page: https://riigzy.itch.io/ciphered-chains

This Code I made to make a pause menu in the game that freezes time and let you click on the buttons.
